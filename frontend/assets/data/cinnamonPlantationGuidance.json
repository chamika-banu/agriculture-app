				"Cinnamomum Zeylanicum, indigenous to Sri Lanka, produces the highest-grade pure cinnamon, known as Ceylon Cinnamon.",
				"Sri Lanka is the world's largest producer and exporter, holding 90% of the global market.",
				"Ceylon Cinnamon is renowned for its unique quality, color, flavor, and aroma, making it superior to Cassia, a cheaper alternative.",
				"Ceylon Cinnamon is used in bakery products, Asian foods, teas, chocolates, desserts, and pharmaceuticals due to its natural flavor and health benefits.",
				"It is particularly known for its high antioxidant content.",
				"Ceylon Cinnamon is categorized into grades (Alba, Continental, Mexican, Hamburg) based on quill diameter, with Alba (6 mm) being the most expensive."

			"title": "Environmental Factors",
			"content": [
				"Cinnamon thrives in temperatures of 25-35Â°C, with annual rainfall above 1875 mm or irrigation in drier areas.",
				"It can be cultivated up to 700 meters elevation in humid conditions (75-85% relative humidity).",
				"Sri Lanka's suitable soils include acidic red soils in the wet zone, sandy loam along coasts, or managed dry zone soils.",
				"Unsuitable lands for cinnamon cultivation include those with poor drainage, waterlogging, salinity, or slopes exceeding 60%.",
				"These conditions hinder commercial cultivation."

			"title": "Cinnamon Cultivation",
			"content": [
				"Cinnamon is planted in full sunlight with 4x3 ft spacing on flat land (9000 pits/ha) or 4x2 ft on slopes (14,000 pits/ha).",
				"Pits (1x1x1 ft) are treated with 25g Eppawala Rock Phosphate, and sulfur is applied in former rubber soils to prevent white root disease.",
				"Planting aligns with the Yala/Maha rainy seasons.",
				"Cultivation involves thinning (keeping 3-5 healthy plants per hole), irrigation (basin, drip, etc.), and weed management by cutting rather than eradication to prevent soil erosion.",
				"Pruning removes cross branches and weak shoots, starting at 1.5 years, with regular cycles to ensure straight stems for bark harvesting."

		{
			"title": "Seed Propagation",
			"content": [
				"Seed propagation uses well-ripened, purple seeds planted in June-July.",
				"Nurseries require sunny, well-drained sites for optimal growth.",
				"Pots (20x12.5 cm) are filled with a potting mix, and 8-10 seeds are planted per pot.",
				"The seeds are covered with a thin soil layer and coir for moisture retention.",
				"Seedlings are ready for field planting in 4-6 months, with pots containing 5-8 healthy plants, 15 cm tall, and free of disease."
			]
		},
		{
			"title": "Vegetative Propagation",
			"content": [
				"Vegetative propagation ensures uniform quality by using semi-hardwood cuttings with active lateral buds from high-quality mother plants.",
				"Cuttings are taken early in the morning, kept in water, and planted in pots with a compacted potting mix in a shaded propagator.",
				"After 4-6 months of acclimatization, plants are ready for field transplantation."
			]

		{
			"title": "Fertilizer Management",
			"content": [
				"Soil nutrient management involves maintaining moisture, acidity, and microorganisms in the soil.",
				"Dolomite is used to regulate soil pH, and fertilization combines 50g inorganic fertilizer with 1kg compost per bush annually.",
				"Fertilizer amounts increase over three years: 60-180 kg/acre nitrogen, 30-90 kg/acre phosphorus, and 30-90 kg/acre potassium.",
				"Fertilizer quantities are adjusted based on spacing and soil tests."
			]
		},
		{
			"title": "Disease and Pest Management",
			"content": [
				"Common diseases include Rough Bark, Leaf Blight, White Root, and Brown Root Rot.",
				"These are managed through pruning, fungicides (e.g., tebuconazole), and soil drainage.",
				"Pests like Pink Stem Borer, Leaf Galls, and Thrips are controlled by covering plant bases, pruning infested leaves, and applying insecticides like Abamectin or Imidacloprid during flushing stages."
